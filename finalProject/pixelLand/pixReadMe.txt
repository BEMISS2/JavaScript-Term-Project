Directions:

This site is intended to be a keyboard movable game. The user uses the keys of their keyboard to move Pixel Dude up, down, left and right in order to navigate around the emoji filled text messages. The goal is to score better than the last time you played every-time you play again.


Current problems or issues: As of right now, there are no current problems or issues that effect playing the game itself.


Plans to resolve issues: As of right now, the only aesthetic issue I would like to work further on is the squishing of the top emoji message bubbles. I have worked and played with fixing this issue, but it still bothers me that they are squished significantly at times.


Images:

All art and graphics were created by Koree Bemiss using art programs.


Purpose:

This game is created by Koree Bemiss using HTML Canvas, JavaScript and CSS for her CIT 190 Javascript college course. Its purpose is to use the CIT 190 learned programs to create games that function properly to fulfill the course outcomes.


Future Releases:

No plans for future releases. I maybe will add levels in the future.
