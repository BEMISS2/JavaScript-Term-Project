Directions:

This site is intended to be a trivia game. The user answers each question and their score gets tallied through their play. The timer is used to have them select answer in a certain amount of time. The answers are not shown through out the game in order to allow the player to play again and improve there score. At the end the players final score is shared and a play agin button will appear.

Current problems or issues: As of right now, there are no current problems or issues.

Plans to resolve issues: As of right now, there are no big issues to resolve. When playing again the timer starts at 19 seconds. This is because the page takes time to load the clear and reset. It is a minor issue.


Images:

No plans for future releases. I maybe will add more questions at a later date or some background sound.
