Purpose:

This site is intended to be an interface for three games created by Koree Bemiss for her CIT 190 class.

This game interface is intended to be used by a mostly millennials and individuals with pop culture knowledge. It's design is loosely inspired by Roy Lichtenstein’s pop art works, in terms of color and dot usage. The red, blue, and yellow, were all used in connection to the artist. The primary color theory was also used for it simplicity and child like fun; however, the colors hues and dot graphics were altered to be more modern and abstract in appearance. The layout is designed to have elements remain center and clean on mobile phones and pads, but float left on larger screens.
